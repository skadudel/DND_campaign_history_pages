            <div class="title2">Ancient history about the gods (not very detailed)</div>
            <div class="text">325k years ago there was one god that was far superior to all who kept balance where and how all the others failed to keep balance, in several ways that made other gods feel like the superior god known as Jeffrey the invincible god of orcas was encroaching on what the other gods believed to be their domain. </div>
            <div class="text">This caused the other gods to start form together to put an end to the superior god Jeffrey who upheld order in the world where the other gods failed. a total of 10 higher gods the weakest of which could rival the strength of 10 great gods, 51 great gods who could each rival the strength of 33 lesser gods and 287 lesser gods all gathered to set a trap and slay Jeffrey. The gods almost succeeded at killing Jeffrey, instead of completely slaying Jeffrey they could only manage to tear Jeffrey apart, making sure that no single part would be greater than one of the higher gods.</div>  
            <div class="text">This lead to numerous new gods forming from the disaster, but also some powers that became natural laws of all worlds that as mighty if not slightly more mighty than the high gods, but all without a consciousness so they were seen as weaker than the high gods in terms of power. Due to the split of Jeffrey creating more gods, those gods only managed to have authority over one or a few different things, and all having just a fraction of Jeffreys mind causing some to be considered evil and some to be considered good, due to Jeffrey being neutral and trying to balance forces of good and evil and had therefore part of their mind being advocates for both evil and good.</div>
